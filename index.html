                    <h4>This story documents Paul Robinson's life after his release from prison, where he served 52 years. Paul maintains his innocence and is working with the <a href="https://www.newenglandinnocence.org/" target="_blank"> New England Innocence Project (NEIP) </a> to overturn his conviction in his fight for justice. We spoke to Paul in January 2023, approximately six months after release.</h4> -->
                    <!-- <div class="intro">
                        <p>For those of us on the outside, it is easy to imagine that release day, the day an incarcerated person is released from prison, is filled with positive emotions — joy, optimism, gratitude and happiness. And while most previously incarcerated people feel these or similar emotions, those are not the only ones. For any incarcerated person, re-entry is an inflection point that brings about happiness but is not devoid of challenges. Some of the challenges of re-entry have been particularly acute for Paul Robinson, a now 76-year-old man who entered the criminal justice system in the 1970s for a crime he maintains he did not commit.</p>
                        <p>Robinson was incarcerated before the invention of the Internet, smartphones and even cell phones. People played music on audio cassettes and Walkmans. He used to pay for items with cash. The neighborhood he grew up in, Roxbury, looks and feels completely different than it did 52 years ago.</p>

                        <p>We asked <b>100</b> disaster restoration workers primarily based in Florida and Louisiana if they had been exposed to asbestos, lead and mold while working to rebuild after natural disasters. 
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            In the conducted survey, a total of <b>100 respondents</b> participated. The gender distribution among the respondents was significantly skewed, with <b>89 respondents</b> identifying as male and <b>11</b> (11%) identifying as female.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding age groups, the respondents spanned a wide range of demographics. The majority of respondents fell into the <b>30-39 (28%)</b> and <b>40-49 (31%)</b> age groups, indicating a significant middle-aged demographic in the survey. The <b>50-59 age group</b> represented <b>20%</b> of respondents, while the <b>20-29 and 60-69 age groups</b> accounted for <b>8% and 12%</b> of respondents, respectively. Only <b>one respondent (1%) was in the 70-79 age group</b>.

                        <p>
                            This data suggests that the survey sample is predominantly male, with a substantial representation of individuals between the ages of 30 and 49. This information can be valuable for further analysis and interpretation of your research findings, depending on the research objectives and questions you are addressing.

                    <p>Despite spending the majority of his life incarcerated for a crime he did not commit, Robinson does not seem resentful, only grateful. His gratitude is a gift and a lesson we can all take away from.</p>
                    <p><i>Personally, myself, I spent a lot of years in prison, many, many years in prison. And I realize that I can't make up for those years that I spent in prison. But my plan is, my thought is, to have a good life from this point on and enjoy what I have. I'm very grateful. I have a strong sense of gratitude in being free again.</i></p>
